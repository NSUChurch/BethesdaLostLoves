The $99 DNA kits from Ancestry.com and 23andMe help us match Bethesda survivors with their missing birth children. Funds raised beyond our DNA kit need will be used to support adoption and genealogy searches, investigations, and to support efforts to STOP the atrocious institutional abuses committed by the troubled teen industry.

Bethesda Lost Loves is a project of [No Stone Unturned](https://nsuchurch.org), an organization committed to eliminating child abuse in the troubled teen industry.
