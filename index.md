## Bethesda Lost Loves

Reuniting Bethesda mothers with their missing children.

## [WE NEED DNA KITS!](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=2CWXZDWKF6TCW)

The $99 DNA kits we purchase from Ancestry.com and 23andMe help us match Bethesda survivors with their missing birth children. 

Funds raised beyond our DNA kit requirements will be used to support adoption and genealogy searches, expenses associated with reuniting families, investigations, and to support efforts to STOP the atrocious institutional abuses committed by the troubled teen industry.

Bethesda Lost Loves is a fundraiser by [No Stone Unturned](https://nsuchurch.org), who is committed to eliminating child abuse in the troubled teen industry.
